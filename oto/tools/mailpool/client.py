"""Mailpool API client — cold-email infrastructure: domains, DNS, mailboxes,
spam checks, warmup.

API v1 (`https://app.mailpool.io/v1/api`, reference https://api.mailpool.ai),
authenticated by the **`X-Api-Authorization: <key>`** header. A key belongs to
a workspace and is created in Mailpool → Settings → API Keys. One method = one
endpoint.

Scope: reading domains, their DNS records and owners, mailboxes, warmup and
subscription slots; editing a domain's DNS and DMARC settings; running spam
checks. Everything that is BILLED is deliberately absent: registering,
transferring or renewing a domain, creating a mailbox, changing subscription
slots, adding an inbox to warmup, inbox-placement tests. So are exports and the
platform credentials they rely on.

What the caller needs to know, and cannot guess:

- ⚠️ **This client never returns a mailbox credential.** Mailbox payloads —
  including the one nested in a spam check — carry the mailbox password, the
  IMAP/SMTP passwords, the admin account's password and secret. A mailbox is
  served as an ALLOWLIST (`MAILBOX_FIELDS`, the closed schema of
  `connectors/mailpool/connector.yaml`; the admin account reduced to its
  address); every other payload loses, at any depth, each key named like a
  credential (`strip_secrets`). Error bodies go through the same filter
  before they reach `UpstreamHTTPError`.

- **Every list requires `limit` and `offset`** (a list called without them is
  refused with 400 "numeric string is expected"). They are always sent.

- ⚠️ **`update_domain_dns` REPLACES the whole record set** of the domain: a
  record left out of the list is deleted. The method therefore carries the
  read-modify-write itself: the caller passes the set it read (`expected`);
  the set is read again and the write refused if it changed meanwhile; a host
  that would lose its MX, SPF or DKIM is refused unless
  `allow_removing_protected=True`; after the write the set is read back, and
  if a record sent is missing the previous set is put back and
  `MailpoolDnsWriteError` raised. Changes reach the public nameservers within
  minutes.

- **The `_dmarc` TXT record is published from the domain's DMARC settings**, not
  from the record set: an edited `_dmarc` record is stored by
  `update_domain_dns` but only goes live after `set_dmarc_email` or
  `set_dmarc_policy`. `set_dmarc_email` writes the address as both `rua` and
  `ruf`.

- `get_domain_dns` returns the configuration stored by Mailpool, not a live DNS
  lookup.

- **Some features are enabled per workspace**: the Google Workspace / Microsoft
  365 availability checks answer 403 "not enabled for this workspace" otherwise.

- A spam check is free and completes within seconds (`state` goes from
  `pending` to `completed`); it is refused with 404 for mailbox types it does
  not support.
