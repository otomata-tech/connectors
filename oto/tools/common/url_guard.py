"""SSRF guard for a base URL supplied by an account administrator.

`assert_public_https_url` accepts only an `https://` URL without credentials
whose host resolves, for every address returned, to a public IP. It is meant to
be called before **each** outgoing request (not only at construction), so a
host whose DNS changes later is still caught. Redirects must be disabled by the
caller (`allow_redirects=False`) and a 3xx turned into an error with
`refuse_redirect`.

Limit: the check resolves the host separately from the connection, so a DNS
answer that changes between the two is not covered.
