"""Microsoft Entra auth — signing in a PERSON (OAuth 2.0, authorization code),
single source for ALL of the lib's Microsoft clients.

The application is the one of the publisher that consumes the lib, registered once as
"multi-tenant" in its own Entra directory: `client_id` + `client_secret`,
passed as arguments. Each person authorizes it from THEIR OWN Microsoft 365 account;
the token returned acts with THEIR rights (DELEGATED permissions), no more, no less.
The permissions asked for are passed explicitly, by surface (`scopes`).

Four operations, one per authorization-server endpoint:
- `authorize_url` — the URL to send the browser to;
- `exchange_code` — the returned code in exchange for a `Grant`;
- `refresh` — a `refresh_token` in exchange for a fresh `Grant`. ⚠️ Entra ROTATES the
  refresh token: the one returned replaces the old one, the caller must store it;
- `admin_consent_url` — the URL a tenant administrator opens to consent, for the
  whole organization, to the scopes a person cannot consent to alone.

`tenant` picks the directory that signs the person in:
- `organizations` (default): any work or school account, in its home tenant;
- a tenant id (GUID) or a verified domain (`contoso.onmicrosoft.com`,
  `contoso.com`): that directory only. This is how a GUEST of the tenant (B2B,
  including a personal Microsoft account invited there) signs in to it —
  `organizations` would send them to their own home directory, or refuse them.
`common` and `consumers` are refused: they admit personal accounts in their own
directory, which has no SharePoint.

Same guards as the lib's other auth modules: the secret goes in **`data=`**, never in
`params=`, and no `raise_for_status()` (its message embeds the URL).
