        ⚠️ `GET /v2/accounts` is PAGINATED by `offset` (`limit` default 20, `has_more`)
        and SORTED BY `name` (OpenAPI v2 "List all Accounts"). This client only read
        the first page: past 20 accounts on a key, any account whose
        name sorts after the 20th became INVISIBLE — with no error, since the returned
        page is perfectly valid. Seen on 2026-09-14: the platform key
        carried more than 20 accounts, and oto-backend's poll-and-bind reconciliation
        (which looks for the freshly connected account IN this list) could no
        longer bind anyone whose name falls after the 20th; the admin seat
        inventory lied by omission (live, in-use seats were missing from it).
        Names early in the alphabet got through: not reproducible
        for someone called Alessandro.

        We advance by the size of the RETURNED page (`limit` is not sent: we
        keep the upstream's default size rather than guess a maximum that
        the docs don't give) until `has_more` is false or a page is empty. Deduplicated
        by `id`: an account created during the walk shifts the alphabetical order
        and can serve an already-seen account again.

        ⚠️ MECHANICAL STOP, same reason as `list_invitations`: if upstream ignored
        `offset` and served the same page again, the loop would never end. Page
        identical to the previous one ⟹ we stop with what we have, and we
        log it — returning the first page stays the previous behavior, not a
        regression. A response without `has_more` (or a bare list) is read as
