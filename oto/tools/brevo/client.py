"""Client for the Brevo v3 PUBLIC API (formerly Sendinblue).

Auth = **v3 API key** in the `api-key` header, created in Brevo:
Settings → SMTP & API → API Keys. A key covers the whole account (no scope).

Covers the core of the platform: contacts/lists/segments, transactional email
and templates, email campaigns, native CRM (deals/companies/tasks/notes).

⚠️ **Not to be confused with the `brevoauto` connector** (`workflow-apis.brevo.com`),
which drives *automations* through the vendor's private API and a browser session.
The two surfaces are disjoint: the v3 API key gives no access to automation
authoring, and the browser session is not used here.

**Deliberately absent writes** (an unlucky LLM call would be costly):
sending a campaign (`sendNow`, switching the status to `sent`), deleting a
contact/list/campaign/template, purging hard bounces. Design and measurement
are exposed; launching a mass send and deletions stay in the UI.
